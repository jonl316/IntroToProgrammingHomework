Sample Homework Assignment
Consider the following computer programming exercise:

We wish to determine if someone is eligible to vote as a resident of one of several countries. This depends on the country itself and the age of the resident. The "rules" are:

    If someone lives in the USA, they can vote if they are 18 or older
    If someone lives in Canada, they can vote if they are 21 or older
    If someone lives in Mexico, they can vote if they are 26 or older
    Any other country or age cannot vote

So, we need a program to take the age and country and simply display the voting status, then stop.


Solution

1) The IPO for this program is:

Input:
country
age

Processing:
none

Output:
votingStatus

Algorithm
1) enter the country and age
2) set voting status to 'N'  as a default
3) use some IF statements for the voting logic, if any case is true set voting status to 'Y'
     if country = U
         if age > 17
             votingStatus = Y
         end if
     else
           if country =C
               if age > 20
                   votingStatus = Y
               end if
           else
                if country = M
                    if age > 25
                        votingStatus = Y
                    end if
           end if
      end if

 4) if votingStatus = Y
         display "can vote"
     else
         display " can't vote"
     end if
 end


Notes:

* Observe that we NEVER place correct syntax in the Algorithm - we don't care about those details yet.
* There are no "==" or quotes or semicolons - this doesn't matter, it's about getting the logic right at this point.
* The use of end if can make it easier to note where ifs start and stop, and spacing them over can also make things easier to see. In C++, though, it's all about getting the braces { and } in the right place. The compiler IGNORES spaces, so even though you should make it look nice for reading how you space over has no effect on the logical order.
* We have decided to use single characters for the country, rather than a full name. That is fine. We also make them capitals only for this program.
* There are several ways to use lower case also (i.e.  'U' or 'u' for USA), see if you recall "toupper" from your book.
* Some people think more graphically and prefer flowchart diagrams for if/else statements, and there are some shown in your book. If that makes more sense to you, feel free to use them.


2) The C++ code is:
      
//Voting Program
// Intro C++, Lesson 6
// Written by Bill H, Jan 2012

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main( )
{
    //Declare variables and constants
    char country = ' ';
    int age = 0;
    char votingStatus = ' ';
   
    //Prompt the user for inputs
    cout << "Enter first letter of country: ";
    cin >> country;
    cout << "Enter age: ";
    cin >> age;

    //Decide voting status
    votingStatus = 'N';
    if (country == 'U')
       {
         if (age > 17)
            votingStatus = 'Y';
        }
    else
        if (country =='C')
        {
            if (age > 20)
             votingStatus = 'Y';
        }
       else
          if (country == 'M')
          {
            if (age > 25)
             votingStatus = 'Y';
          }

    //Display the result
   if (votingStatus == 'Y')
        cout << "This person CAN vote." <<endl;
  else
    cout << "This person CANNOT vote." <<endl;

    system("pause");
    return 0;
} //end of main


Another Sample Problem

Imagine we are buying a car and the purchase price has to be determined from a base amount and some options. We would enter the base, then add costs based on the following tables:

Engine
Additional Cost
4 cylinder
$0
6 cylinder
$575
Diesel
$950


Trim Level
Additional Cost
Basic
$0
Standard
$1200
Fancy
$2500

Radio
Additional Cost
None
$0
AM/FM
$250
AM/FM + CD
$450


Each one would need an input code, then we could determine the purchase price and display it, then stop.


Solution

1) The IPO for this program is:

Input:
basePrice
engineCode
trimCode
radioCode

Processing:
enginePrice
trimPrice
radioPrice

Output:
purchasePrice

Algorithm
1) enter the basePrice and all codes
2) use some IF statements for the price logic
     if engineCode = 4
          enginePrice = 0
      else
            if engineCode  = 6
                  enginePrice = 575
            else
                  enginePrice = 950
            end if
     end if
    
     if trimCode = B
          trimPrice = 0
     else
           if trimCode = S
               trimPrice = 1200
          else
               trimPrice = 2500
          end if        
     end if
  
     if radioCode = N
          radioPrice = 0
     else
           if radioCode = A
                radioPrice = 250
           else
                radioPrice = 450
         end if
     end if
3) purchasePrice = basePrice + enginePrice + trimPrice + radioPrice
4) display purchasePrice
 end


2) The C++ code is:
   
    
//Car Sales Program
// Intro C++, Lesson 6
// Written by Bill H, Jan 2012

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

int main( )
{
  //Declare variables and constants
  double basePrice = 0.0;
  char engineCode = ' ';
  char trimCode = ' ';
  char radioCode = ' ' ;
  double enginePrice = 0.0;
  double trimPrice = 0.0;
  double radioPrice = 0.0;
  double purchasePrice = 0.0;
   
  //Prompt the user for inputs
  cout << "Enter the base price of the car: $";
  cin >> basePrice;
  cout << "Enter engine code (4,6,D): ";
  cin >> engineCode;
  cout << "Enter trim code (B,S,F): ";
  cin >> trimCode;
  cout << "Enter radio code (N,A,C): ";
  cin >> radioCode;
 
  //Decide on the costs
  if (engineCode == '4')
          enginePrice = 0.0;    
  else
        if (engineCode == '6')
             enginePrice = 575.0;
        else
            enginePrice =  950.0;

  if (trimCode == 'B')
          trimPrice = 0.0;   
  else
        if (trimCode == 'S')
             trimPrice = 1200.0;
        else
            trimPrice =  2500.0;

  if (radioCode == 'N')
          trimPrice = 0.0;  
  else
        if (radioCode == 'A')
            radioPrice = 250.0;
        else
            radioPrice =  450.0;
 
 //Total it all up..
 purchasePrice = basePrice + enginePrice + trimPrice + radioPrice;
 
 //Display the result
 cout << fixed << setprecision(2); 
 cout << "The final car purchase price is: $" << purchasePrice <<endl;

 system("pause");
 return 0;
} //end of main
